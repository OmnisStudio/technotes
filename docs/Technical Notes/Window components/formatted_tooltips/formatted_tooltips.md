### Enhancing your Tool Tips

There is a great feature in Omnis Studio that allows you to popup a tooltip that shows some information when the user hovers their mouse over an item, for example, hovering over the cells in a Complex grid.

With the following technique, you can automatically call a function that receives a reference to the row of the data list, and in addition you can use the `style()` function to give your tooltip a better appearance.

#### Formatted tool tips

To show how you can create formatted tooltips, I have created a window with a Complex grid. Each field in the grid has the following argument within its `$tooltip` property using square brackets:

```omnis
[$cinst.$getTooltip(ivDataList.[mouseover(kMLine)].$ref())]
```

The `$getTooltip` method receives a reference to the row under the mouse and contains the following code to format the tooltip:

```omnis
Begin text block (Carriage return) Line:[style(kEscBmp,1694)] Row: [pRow.$ident] Line:
Line:[style(kEscStyle,kBold)]Column1:[style(kEscStyle,kPlain)] [con(upp(pRow.C1))] Line:Column2: [pRow.C2]
Line:[style(kEscStyle,kBold)]Column3: [style(kEscColor,kBlue)] [pRow.C3] [style(kEscColor,kBlack] [style(kEscStyle,kPlain)])]
Line:Column4: [style(kEscColor,kRed)] [pRow.C4] [style(kEscColor,kBlack)] End text block
Get text block lvToolTip
Quit method lvToolTip
```

The method uses the `style()` function to implement certain formatting properties such as adding an icon, and changing the font style and colors of the text.

There is a sample [library](/assets/formatted_tooltips/tooltip.zip) which demonstrates this technique (compatible with Omnis Studio 11 revision 35659 or above).
