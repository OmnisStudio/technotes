title: Installing required packages
---

Once Python is installed, you need to install some packages in order to facilitate the communication between Python and Omnis Studio.

Navigate to the writable directory of your Omnis Studio installation, typically located inside the **AppData** folder on Windows or the **Application Support** folder on macOS. On Linux, the writable and read-only directories are the same.

Inside the writable directory, locate the **pyworker** folder, inside of which you will find a **requirements.txt** file containing all the packages Python requires to communicate with Omnis Studio. Using a terminal inside the **pyworker** folder, execute `path/to/python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the packages listed in the requirements file.

Please note we use the absolute path to the Python executable when installing these packages as you can have multiple installations of Python and inadvertently add the packages to the wrong installation, leading to the Python Worker not starting.
