title: Installing Python and pip
---

At the time of writing, the OW3 Python Worker uses Python version 3, which can be downloaded from [Python's download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Since Python is interpreted, any version of Python 3 should be supported, unless a breaking change is introduced over time.

Download an install the appropriate package for your operative system and that should make Python and pip available on your system. Please note, on the Windows installer, you might have to manually tick to install pip during the installation process.
