### whoami

One of the simplest yet useful examples of the oProcess Worker is to call out to the `whoami` executable in order to retrieve the username.

For this example, we will create a new variable object called **proc** and inherit from the oProcess Worker:

![oProcess Worker Variable](assets/../../../../assets/oprocess_worker_images/proc_variable.png)

Due to the simple nature of the command, we will reuse the current instance for the completion callbacks - we can do it by setting the **$callbackinst** property on the **proc** object to **$cinst** and create a **$completed** method in your class.

Next, we can call **$init** and **$start** on the **proc** object:

```js
Do proc.$callbackinst.$assign($cinst)
Do proc.$init('whoami')
Do proc.$start()
```

Once the **whoami** executable finishes, a callback to your **$completed** method will be generated with a list as the first parameter containing two columns: **retcode** indicating the return code (ideally should be 0 for a successful outcome!) and **runtime_seconds** (which due to the speed of the command, might just be 0).

At this point, we know the process has finished executing and we're ready to retrieve our **stdout** by using **$readlines()**:

```js
Do proc.$readlines(kOProcessStdout) Returns myList
```

If we look into **myList**, we can see a **stdout** column containing the text written to the stdout during the process lifetime, which in our case is our username:
