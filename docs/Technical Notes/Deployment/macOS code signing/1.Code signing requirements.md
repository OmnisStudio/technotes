## Code signing certificate

In order to sign your application, you will need a code signing certificate which can be obtained from your Apple Developer account.

Here's a step-by-step guide on obtaining a valid code signing certificate:

* Create an Apple Developer Account
    * If you don't already have one, you will need to create an Apple Developer account. Visit the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/) and sign up. Note that to access certain resources, a paid membership may be required.

* Access the Apple Developer Portal
    * Once your account is set up, log in to the [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

* Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
    * On your Mac, open the Keychain Access application.
    * From the menu bar, select Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority.
    * Enter your email address and name. Choose 'Saved to disk' and continue. This action generates a CSR file.

* Request a Signing Certificate
    * In the Apple Developer portal, navigate to the 'Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles' section.
    * Select 'Certificates' and click the '+' to add a new certificate.
    * Choose the `Apple Developer ID` certificate type (used for signing macOS apps to prepare them for distribution outside the Mac App Store and for notarization) and continue.
    * When prompted, upload the CSR file you generated earlier and complete the certificate request.

* Download and Install Your Certificate
    * Once your certificate request is approved, you can download it from the Apple Developer portal.
    * Double-click the downloaded certificate to install it in your Keychain Access.

* Verify Certificate Installation
    * In Keychain Access, under the 'My Certificates' category, verify that your new certificate is listed and valid.

    * Go to Preferences > Locations.
    * In the 'Command Line Tools' dropdown, select the latest version of the Xcode command-line tools.

* Verify Installation
    * After installation, rerun `xcode-select -p` in the Terminal. It should now display the path to the installed command-line tools.
