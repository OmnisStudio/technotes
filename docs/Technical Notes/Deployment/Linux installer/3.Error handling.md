title: Error handling
---

If an error occurs during the installation process, the .run will write further details to either stdout or a **.log** file.

The **.log** file will be created in the current directory of the .run and will have a name of [omnis version]_installer.log. 

If using unattended installation, errors will always be redirected to the .log file.

Please note that if the user running the .run has no rights to create or write to the .log file, regardless of whether it's an unattended installation, the error output will go to stdout.
