title: Creating Dockerfile
---

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

Please visit Docker's [documentation on Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) for further references and details.

Here's an example Dockerfile that we'll explore in details:

``` Dockerfile
FROM debian:11-slim

WORKDIR /home

ARG runfile

ENV install_directory /home/omnisserver
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${install_directory}
ENV OMNIS_PORT 80

RUN apt-get -q -y update
RUN apt-get -q -y install \
	vim \
	lsof \
	htop \
	procps \
	sudo

COPY ${runfile} /
RUN chmod +x /${runfile}

RUN /${runfile} unattended \
	install-dependencies \
	stacks 5 \
	timeslice 20 \
	destination-dir "${install_directory}" \
	port ${OMNIS_PORT} \
	serial "SERIAL_NUMBER_WITHOUT_SPACES"

# Add startup libraries:
ADD libs /tmp/libs
RUN cp -R /tmp/libs/* ${install_directory}/startup
RUN rm -r /tmp/libs

EXPOSE ${OMNIS_PORT}

ENTRYPOINT ${install_directory}/homnis
```

---

At the beginning of our Dockerfile, we do `FROM debian:11-slim` which means we will use the **slim** version of **Debian 11** as our base image.

You don't have to use the same version or distro, in fact you could use Ubuntu if you want to - the reason we decided to use a slim version of Debian is to have a base image as slim and as bare-bones as possible, so that we can install just what we need on top of it. See more at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from).

---

``` Dockerfile
WORKDIR /home
```

`WORKDIR` simply sets the container's current working directory as `/home`. See more at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir).

---

``` Dockerfile
ARG runfile
```

`ARG` defines an argument for the Dockerfile that takes the name of `runfile`. We use this to provide the path to the Omnis Headless .run file to our Dockerfile. See more at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg).

---

``` Dockerfile
ENV install_directory /home/omnisserver
ENV LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${install_directory}
ENV OMNIS_PORT 80
```

We use `ENV` to declare a few environment variables: the install directory which in this case will be `/home/omnisserver`, then we specify the install directory to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to ensure any Omnis-specific libraries are found and finally create the `OMNIS_PORT` environment variable and set it to `80`.

You can use any other port as you desire, up to 65535 (usually port numbers up to 1023 are reserved, 1024 to 49151 should be used for user server applications and 49152 to 65535 for clients).

See more about `ENV` at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env).

---

``` Dockerfile
RUN apt-get -q -y update
RUN apt-get -q -y install \
	vim \
	lsof \
	htop \
	procps \
	sudo
```

We use `RUN` to update our `apt-get` package indexes and then we invoke `apt-get install` (with some extra options such as `-q` and `-y` for quiet and automatically accept all the details) to install a few utilities such as vim, sudo and htop. These are useful for debugging issues on a running container.

See more about `RUN` at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run).

---

``` Dockerfile
COPY ${runfile} /
RUN chmod +x /${runfile}
```

We use `COPY` to make a copy of our `.run` file which we had passed in as an argument inside the container. Afterwards, we use `chmod +x` to give it the executable attribute.

See more about `COPY` at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy).

---

``` Dockerfile
RUN /${runfile} unattended \
	install-dependencies \
	stacks 5 \
	timeslice 20 \
	destination-dir "${install_directory}" \
	port ${OMNIS_PORT} \
	serial "SERIAL_NUMBER_WITHOUT_SPACES"
```

Once our `.run` file is an executable, we can launch it in `unattended` mode and pass it a few options such as the serial number and the port we wish it to run on. Please note we use the previously defined `OMNIS_PORT` environment variable.

---

``` Dockerfile
ADD libs /tmp/libs
RUN cp -R /tmp/libs/* ${install_directory}/startup
RUN rm -r /tmp/libs
```

Once we installed the Omnis Headless server, we use the `ADD` command to add a folder named `libs` to the `/tmp/libs` location in the container. The `libs` folder **must** be local to the Dockerfile.

Afterwards, we copy the contents of the libs folder into the **startup** folder of our Omnis Headless installation and remove the libs folder because it's no longer needed.

---

``` Dockerfile
EXPOSE ${OMNIS_PORT}
```

One of the final steps is to `EXPOSE` the port number which our Omnis Headless installation is running on. In this case, we use the previously defined `OMNIS_PORT` environment variable.

See more at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose).

---

``` Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ${install_directory}/homnis
```

Finally, we set our `ENTRYPOINT` as the `homnis` process. See more at [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint).
