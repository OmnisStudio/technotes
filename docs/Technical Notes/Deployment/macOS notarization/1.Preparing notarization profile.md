title: Preparing the notarization profile
---

The first step is to get all the Apple developer certificates needed for notarization.

You will require an Apple developer account with a valid Developer ID certiticate.

## Generate an app-specific password

Apple has documented the neccessary steps to generate app-specific passwords [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654).

You are required to log into your [Apple ID](appleid.apple.com) account (use your developer account) and use the **Sign-In and Security** section to generate an **App-Specific Password**.

## Save profile to Keychain

With the app-specific password in our hands, we should save the provider profile to keychain to make notarisaition as simple as possible.

---

First, we are going to need the team ID of a valid provider.

We can use `altool` to get a list of providers: the command will prompt us for the app-specific password we generated in the previous step.

```bash
xcrun altool --list-providers --username "andrei.augustin@omnis.net"
```

From the returned list of available providers, make a note of the team ID, which should be in the **WWDRTeamID** column.
```bash
ProviderName       ProviderShortname    PublicID     WWDRTeamID 
------------------ ----------------- -------------- ------------ 
Omnis Software Ltd   [ redacted ]     [ redacted ]   B6959HWR8Y 
```

---

Second, we use `notarytool` to store the credentials of our team ID.

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials --apple-id "andrei.augustin@omnis.net" --password "ENTER_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD" --team-id "ENTER_YOUR_TEAM_ID"
```

The notarytool will prompt you for a profile name, this can be anything you like but please bear in mind you will refer to the profile name during the notarisation phase.

In our case, we named it **NotaryProfile**.

If you wish to make sure the profile has been saved, launch the **Keychain.app** and search for the profile name you've given the `notarytool store-credentials` command:
