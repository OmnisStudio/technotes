title: Using installers
---

If you're using an installer which creates an executable (as is the case for **.pkg** packages) you will need to notarise your package as well.

Please consult your packaging tool's documentation for their requirements, but a general rule of thumb is code signing the package, compress it into a zip archive and use `notarytool` to submit it for notarization, followed by stapling (given a successful notarization outcome, of course).

If you package your application in a **.dmg** archive, it does not create an executable, meaning you should be able to distribute your application unless Apple updates their requirements in the future.
