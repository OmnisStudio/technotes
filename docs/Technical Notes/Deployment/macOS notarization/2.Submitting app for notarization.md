title: Submitting application for notarization
---

In order to submit our application to Apple for notarization, we will zip it up and then use the `notarytool submit` command with the Keychain profile we saved in the previous section.

```bash
xcrun notarytool submit "/path/to/Omnis.zip" --keychain-profile "NotaryProfile" --wait
```

Once submitted, the `--wait` switch ensures the command doesn't return until the submission has been processed by the Apple notary service.

Without `--wait`, you will need to manually check if Apple's notary service has finished processing your submission.

If you cannot remember your Keychain profile, open the **Keychain.app** and search for **notary**: once found, look for the **Account** attribute - the last part of which will be the profile name.

For example, if the account attribute reads `com.apple.gke.notary.tool.saved-creds.NotaryProfile`, then your keychain profile name is `NotaryProfile`.
