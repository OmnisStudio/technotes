title: Submitting application for notarization
---

In order to submit our application to Apple for notarization, we will zip it up and then use the `notarytool submit` command with the Keychain profile we saved in the previous section.

```bash
xcrun notarytool submit "/path/to/Omnis.zip" --keychain-profile "NotaryProfile" --wait
```

Once submitted, the `--wait` switch ensures the command doesn't return until the submission has been processed by the Apple notary service.

Without `--wait`, you will need to manually check if Apple's notary service has finished processing your submission.

---

If you cannot remember your Keychain profile, open the **Keychain.app** and search for **notary**: once found, look for the **Account** attribute - the last part of which will be the profile name.

For example, if the account attribute reads `com.apple.gke.notary.tool.saved-creds.NotaryProfile`, then your keychain profile name is `NotaryProfile`.

---

If your notarization comes back invalid like in the following case:

```bash
Processing complete
  id: 2667f8c3-dfee-4357-9703-dfb5f7648b50
  status: Invalid
```

 You can use `notarytool log` to obtain more details on why it failed:

```bash
xcrun notarytool log 2667f8c3-dfee-4357-9703-dfb5f7648b50 --keychain-profile "NotaryProfile"
```

The log details will come back in JSON format:

```bash
...
  "status": "Invalid",
  "statusSummary": "Archive contains critical validation errors",
  "statusCode": 4000,
...
```
And they will contain specifics:

```bash
...
    {
      "severity": "error",
      "code": null,
      "path": "[redacted]",
      "message": "The signature does not include a secure timestamp.",
      "docUrl": "https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution/resolving_common_notarization_issues#3087733",
      "architecture": "arm64"
    }
...
```

You can use this information to identify the specific components that are preventing a successful notarization.
